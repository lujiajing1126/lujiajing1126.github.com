Long time no writing blogs, I hava been thinking of writing or noting something what I've met during the work

And also I am glad to share solutions and expriences with all of you

In the past, I used ```Wordpress``` as my Blog Application
<!-- more -->
But I consider it as a heavy one and it need to be configured properly and backup punctually

I lost my Blog Posts twice so that I felt greatly disappointed about it

Now, I use ```Jekyll``` -- a wondoerful static blog generator written in Ruby -- which make me controll all the things fluently

What technicals, plugins or themes I use in my blog

  - Jekyll
  - Pure By Yahoo
  - JekyllPure Theme
  - Bower By Twitter
  - Hosted On Github Pages
